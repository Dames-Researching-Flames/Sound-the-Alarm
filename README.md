## Project Description


## The Plan

**Plan - Acquire - Prepare - Explore - Model - Deliver**






 
## Initial Questions

- What locations are the most and least fire-prone? 
- How does fire size vary by location?
- How has the occurrence of wildfires changed over time? 
- How does wildfire seasonality vary by location?
- Are wildfires more destructive now than they were in the past? 
- What are the most common causes of wildfires? Is there anything that can be done to prevent that?
- How has containment time changed over time? Is it taking longer to contain and extinguish fires?
